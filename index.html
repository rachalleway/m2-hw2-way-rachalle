        <h1>Hello! My name is Rachalle!</h1>
        <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born in Henderson, Nevada about 20 minutes from the glittery streets of Las Vegas. When I was in first grade, I moved to Melbourne, Florida. I recently graduated the University of Florida with a Bachelor's in Advertsing. I'm currently working part time as an assistant graphic designer at a small, remote digital marketing agency. I'm also working full time as a graduate student hoping to earn an MA in Mass Communications with a Concentration in Web Design by the end of Fall 2023.</p>
        <h2>For the Love of Design</h2>
        <p>Since I was young, I remember always having a love for creativity and art. This love only blossomed during my time at UF where I explored my great and growing passion for graphic design. During my time at UF, I designed for many student organizations and publications as a graphic designer where I was able to develop my skills and explore the intricacies of what it's like to design for a team. One of the publications I designed for was <a href="https://www.rowdymagazine.com/">Rowdy Magazine</a>, the nation's largest student-run magazine for pop culture, fashion, and politics.</p>
        <h3>What I Love Most About Design</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>There's always room for improvement</li>
            <li>You don't have to stick to one style of design</li>
            <li>The type of project you're working on always changes</li>
            <li>Design is a solution to a problem and always serves a purpose</li>
            <li>Design is strategic</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Where I Hope to Go</h2>
        <p>After I finish my MA, I hope to work full time as a graphic designer, web designer, or product designer. Alongside this, I also hope to work as a freelance designer focusing on branding and illustration projects. Ultimately, with much more experience, I hope to transition into becoming a creative director of an advertising agency or well-known brand. I'm very excited for the journey ahead of me and open-minded to the different career opportunities I'll have.</p>
        <h2>In My Free Time</h2>
        <p>When I'm not designing or studying, I enjoy working on DIY projects where I can keep my creative mind working and have the opportunity to work with my hands. I also love exploring for new restaurants and the next best local dish in my area. Most of all, I love watching movies. Whether it's a buzz-worthy indie drama and the latest and greatest blockbuster, I love watching movies and binging the what's popular sections for TV on streaming services. Some of my latest favorites? Everything Everywhere All At Once, Succession, House of the Dragon, and Nope.</p>
